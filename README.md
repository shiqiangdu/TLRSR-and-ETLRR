# TLRSR
Matlab code for tensor low-rank and sparse representation (TLRSR).
There are two folders here, one for face clustering and the other for image restoration.
Demo_clustering_toy.m for synthetic tensor data;
Demo_clustering_frdue.m for human face clustering on frdue dataset;
Demo_denoising.m for image restoration with 20% noise.
